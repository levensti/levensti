- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven. Thanks for spending some time here.
- 👨‍💻 I currently work on payments orchestration at Meta as a backend engineer. Before that, I've shipped code at Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Zoom, Capital One, and for some of my own endeavors.
- 📝 Outside of engineering, I also write a [technology column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenli1/) for Forbes, where I sit with founders of unicorn startups and attempt to share the most detailed account of how they built their companies.
- 🚗 Besides engineering and writing, I'm also proud to have delivered groceries and food for Instacart and DoorDash, which I think are incredible businesses.
- 💡 I'm a big fan of learning new things but am most interested in fintech and marketplaces that have the potential to create new user behaviors. 
- 📫 If anything here sounds interesting, I would love to hear from you. You can reach me at levensti [at] gmail [dot] com.
