- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven. Thanks for spending some time here.
- 🌱 I currently work on payments orchestration at Meta as a backend engineer. Before that, I've shipped code at Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Zoom, Capital One, and for some of my own endeavors. I'm also proud to have delivered groceries and food for Instacart and DoorDash, which I think are incredible businesses.
- 📫 I'm a big fan of learning new things but am most interested in fintech and marketplaces that have the potential to create new user behaviors. If anything here sounds interesting, I would love to hear from you. You can reach me at levensti [at] gmail [dot] com.
