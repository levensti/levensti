- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven.
- 👨‍💻 I'm the creator and tech lead of the Gen AI Synthetic Data Platform at Meta.
- 📝 Outside of engineering, I also write a [technology column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenli1/) for Forbes, where I interview founders of startups that are now worth over $1 billion and attempt to share the most detailed account of how they built their companies.
- 💡 I'm a big fan of learning new things. Today, I'm most interested in AI, fintech, and marketplaces that have the potential to create new user behaviors. 
- 📫 If anything here sounds interesting, I would love to hear from you. You can reach me at levensti [at] gmail [dot] com.
